# Cirtec Integration Project

## Description
This project aims to design and fabricate a board to implement both CSI040 and CSI080 chips from Cirtec Medical, for a medical device to stimulate and sense evoked potentials in the brain (via invasive probe) to measure connectivity and neuronal plasticity in stroke patients during rehabilitation, as well as promoting rehabilitation.

## Components
* CSI040 - Stimulation chip from Cirtec
* CSI080 - Sensing chip from Cirtec
* Adafruit ESP32-S3 Feather - Microcontroller, dual SPI, Wifi and Bluetooth support

## Software Tools
* KiCad - PCB Design software
