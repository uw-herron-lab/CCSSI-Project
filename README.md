# Cirtec Integration Project

## Description
This project aims to design and fabricate a board to implement both CSI040 and CSI080 chips from Cirtec Medical, for a medical device to stimulate and sense evoked potentials in the brain (via invasive probe).

## Components
* CSI040 - Stimulation chip from Cirtec
* CSI080 - Sensing chip from Cirtec
* Adafruit ESP32-S3 Feather - Microcontroller, dual SPI, Wifi and Bluetooth support
* SN74LV1T34DBVR - Level Shifters
* LTC3035EDDB#TRMPBF - Level Dropout Regulator (3V3 -> 1.8V)

## Software Tools
* KiCad - PCB Design software

## Instructions
* To import PCB Designs, clone repo and in KiCAD, Open Project and select the .pro file.
